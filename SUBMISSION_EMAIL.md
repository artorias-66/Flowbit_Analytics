The repository contains:
- Complete source code for all three services (monorepo structure using Turborepo)
- Docker configurations for containerized deployment
- Prisma schema and migrations
- Comprehensive documentation (README, setup guides, deployment instructions)
- Environment variable templates

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Recharts for data visualization

**API Backend:**
- Node.js + Express
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- TypeScript
- RESTful API design

**AI Service:**
- FastAPI (Python)
- Vanna AI library
- Groq API integration (llama-3.3-70b-versatile model)
- PostgreSQL database connectivity

**Database:**
- Neon PostgreSQL (production)
- Automated migrations via Prisma

**Deployment:**
- Vercel (Frontend)
- Render (API + Vanna AI containers)
- Docker multi-stage builds
- Environment-based configuration

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

1. **Invoice Analytics Dashboard**
   - Year-to-date statistics (total spend, invoice count, average value)
   - Monthly invoice trend visualization
   - Category-wise spending breakdown
   - Top vendors by spend analysis
   - Searchable and filterable invoice table

2. **AI-Powered Chat Interface**
   - Natural language query processing
   - Real-time SQL generation using Groq LLM
   - Direct database query execution
   - Formatted response with both data and natural language summary
   - Intelligent fallback patterns for reliability

3. **Robust API Layer**
   - Invoice management endpoints
   - Vendor and customer analytics
   - Statistical aggregations
   - Health monitoring
   - Automated data seeding

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

All services are live and fully functional. You can:
1. Visit the frontend URL to explore the dashboard
2. Navigate to `/chat` to test AI queries (examples: "What are the top 5 vendors by spend?", "Show monthly spend trend for last 6 months")
3. Check API health endpoints to verify backend connectivity
4. Review the GitHub repository for code quality and documentation

## 📋 Additional Notes

- The application uses production-grade PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon
- All environment variables are securely configured in respective hosting platforms
- Docker containers ensure consistent deployment across environments
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented throughout
- The AI service includes fallback SQL patterns for critical queries to ensure reliability

Thank you for this opportunity to showcase my full-stack development skills. I'm excited about the possibility of joining the Flowbit team and would be happy to discuss any aspects of the implementation in detail.
